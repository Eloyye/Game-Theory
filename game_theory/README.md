# Snippet of Game Theory

The following snippet is about game theory which handles the Game state that can be used 
to add players into the game. The game starts by having pairs of players facing off against 
each other and a player must face every player at least once. The face off round conducts 
a move by a player in which they can either choose to confess or to cooperate. The players 
take in previous decisions to guide their decision making. I've also added an option 
to have a move by the player occassionally have random, corrupted moves.
